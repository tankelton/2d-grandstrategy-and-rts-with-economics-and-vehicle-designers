Description

a 2d grandstrategy and rts game that starts at the begining of the industrial revolution with the player being the mayor of a small town.

the town has its own market where the farmers and blacksmiths and the other 19th century industries a small town would have, can sell their products.
their is also a post office and turnpike so communications can happen with other towns run by NPCs.

as time progresses they mayor of the town can expand to takeover neighbouring areas, and can eventualy run the country.


each town is based on a 2d tile grid system that is used for an a* movement algorhithm, that allows pawns to move and allows things to be built. there is also a z-index system that allows multiple story building and underground works, alongisde eventually, flying.

inside buildings there is a seperate tile system so funriture and machinery can be installed.

Each pawn in the town has it own motivations based on maslows hierarchy of needs. 
if a pawn has a job it gets paid a wage and then chooses how to spend that money or whether to save it.  if the pawn doesnt have money it has to find a way to survive, which leads to things like needing a police force, prisons, judges etc.

there is then a a research tree that allows new technology and ideas based on economics, science, politics, etc.

and a designer tool that allows technologies to be combined together. so for example if we have researched a stationary steam engine and we have a wooden cart in the inventory, we can try to attach the two together and see what happens.

in the game all materials have specific attributes, so insulation, conductivity, maleability, hardness, etc. and then they can be combined together so, composite bows, alloy metals, carbon fibre.


then there is the military side, where you recruit troops, produce weapons, train them,  create officers, and design formations.
then there is the terrain effect so if a unit is stood behind a hill it cant be seen by the enemy (unless they have aircraft) and if they are on high ground versus the enemy they have an advantage. etc etc etc.
